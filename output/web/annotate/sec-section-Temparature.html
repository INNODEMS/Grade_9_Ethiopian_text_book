    Why Temperature?
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Have you ever heated water when making pasta? When you heat a pot of water, the temperature gradually increases. At 100Â°C , the water begins to boil. You need to bring water to a boil before adding the pasta. The high temperature of boiling water cooks the pasta quickly, changing its texture from hard to soft. If the water is not hot enough, the pasta will not cook properly, and if the water is too hot (in some cases), it might cause the pasta to cook unevenly.

So, understanding the precise temperature helps ensure that food is prepared properly!
  &lt;/p&gt;
