  "body": " Pythagorean relationship     A triangle that contains a right angle (an angle that measures ,symbolized by a small square \"â–¡\") is called a right triangle.    The longest side of the right triangle (the side opposite the angle) is called the hypotenuse and the other two (shorter) sides are called the legs of the triangle.    The legs of a right triangle are commonly labeled \" \" and \" \"while the hypotenuse is labeled \"            Pythagorean relationship is used in real life in different areas. We use the pythagorean relationship in capentry to desighn houses, furniture,fields,land sub-division,When designing buildings or rooms eg your classroom, In sports like basketball, football, or soccer, and many more.    About 2000 years ago, an amazing discovery was made about right angled triangles. If squares of length equivalent to the sides of the triangle, then the sum of the area of the two small squares is exactly the same as the area of the large square. As shown in the figure below;   The ubove description for about 2000 years   Where , and represent the sides of the right-angled triangle       Work in Groups.  Read the story below.   Harriet and Henry are Grade 7 learners. During the August holiday, they visited their grandmother,who lives nearby a village. Their grandmother is a grocer.

Here is the correct Learning point.         The figure formed between the tree, ladder and the ground is a right-angled tringle.    A right-angle triangle has three sides: the base , the perpendicular height and the hypotenuse .    The side that is long is the perpendicular height .    The side that is long is the base .    The side that is long is the hypotenuse .    The longest side in a right-angled triangle is the hypotenuse .    The two shorter sides of this figure are the base and the perpendicular height .

The figure below shows a parallelogram with base and height labeled.       Muchemi's piece of land is in the shape below.   Parallelogram   What is the area of the piece of land?       The area of the piece of land is .    NOTE:     When calculating the area of a parallelogram ensure you use the formula Area     For any drawn figure ensure you've obtaine both the base and height before incoopereting the formula.       Area of a rhombus  A rhombus is a type of quadrilateral that is a special kind of parallelogram. The key characteristics of a rhombus are:     Opposite sides are parallel.    All sides have equal length.    Opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary (they add up to 180Â°).    The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles (90Â°), meaning they intersect at a right angle and divide each other into two equal parts.     The formula for the area of a rhombus can be given in two common ways:     Using the diagonals:   where:   and are the lengths of the two diagonals.    Using the base and height:   Where the base is the length of any side (since all sides are equal) and the height is the perpendicular distance between opposite sides.

The cube you have made is called a cubic metre. It's sides are long.  The volume of the cube is      making cubes    Conversion of cubic metres to cubic centimetres.  Measure the length, the width and the height of the cube in metres . Work out it's volume in cubic metres.   Measure the length, the width and the height of the cube in centimetres. Work out it's volume in cubic centimetres.   How many cubic centimetres is one cubic metre? How can you convert the volume you got in cubic metres to cubic centimetres? Since   Therefore to convert volume from cubic metres to cubic centimetres, we multiply the volume by 1,000,000.  "

  "body": " Temparature  Why Temperature?  Have you ever heated water when making pasta? When you heat a pot of water, the temperature gradually increases. At 100Â°C , the water begins to boil. You need to bring water to a boil before adding the pasta. The high temperature of boiling water cooks the pasta quickly, changing its texture from hard to soft. If the water is not hot enough, the pasta will not cook properly, and if the water is too hot (in some cases), it might cause the pasta to cook unevenly. So, understanding the precise temperature helps ensure that food is prepared properly!       "
