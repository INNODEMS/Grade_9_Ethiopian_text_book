We use the pythagorean relationship in surveying,engineering and capentry to desighn houses, furniture,fields and land sub-division.

If squares of length equivalent to the sides of the triangle, then the sum of the area of the two small squares is exactly the same as the area of the large square.

The area of the piece of land is .    NOTE:     When calculating the area of a parallelogram ensure you use the formula Area     For any drawn figure ensure you've obtaine both the base and height before incoopereting the formula.       Area of a rhombus  A rhombus is a type of quadrilateral that is a special kind of parallelogram. The key characteristics of a rhombus are:     Opposite sides are parallel.    All sides have equal length.    Opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary (they add up to 180°).    The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles (90°), meaning they intersect at a right angle and divide each other into two equal parts.     The formula for the area of a rhombus can be given in two common ways:     Using the diagonals:   where:   and are the lengths of the two diagonals.    Using the base and height:   Where the base is the length of any side (since all sides are equal) and the height is the perpendicular distance between opposite sides.

The cube you have made is called a cubic metre. It's sides are long.  The volume of the cube is      making cubes    Conversion of cubic metres to cubic centimetres.  Measure the length, the width and the height of the cube in metres . Work out it's volume in cubic metres.   Measure the length, the width and the height of the cube in centimetres.
