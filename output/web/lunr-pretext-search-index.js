If squares of length equivalent to the sides of the triangle, then the sum of the area of the two small squares is exactly the same as the area of the large square.

When you divide the circumfrence by the diameter of any circular object, the number you get is approximately correct to two decimal places.

The area of the piece of land is .    NOTE:     When calculating the area of a parallelogram ensure you use the formula Area     For any drawn figure ensure you've obtaine both the base and height before incoopereting the formula.       Area of a rhombus  A rhombus is a type of quadrilateral that is a special kind of parallelogram. The key characteristics of a rhombus are:     Opposite sides are parallel.    All sides have equal length.    Opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary (they add up to 180°).    The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles (90°), meaning they intersect at a right angle and divide each other into two equal parts.     The formula for the area of a rhombus can be given in two common ways:     Using the diagonals:   where:   and are the lengths of the two diagonals.    Using the base and height:   Where the base is the length of any side (since all sides are equal) and the height is the perpendicular distance between opposite sides.

To determine the amount of liquids we consume, amount of fuel we use in cars or lamps and the amount of water and milk we use to cook, we apply the knowledge of volume and capacity.   volume      Cubic metre as a unit of measuing volume      what you need: Twelve sticks of length     Old pieces of paper    A pair of scissors.    A ruler    Pieces of string.    Join the twelve sticks to form a cube like the one shown on the right. use the pieces of paper to cover it to make a closed cube.    what is the volume of the cube you have made?    The cube you have made is called a cubic metre. It's sides are long.  The volume of the cube is      making cubes    Conversion of cubic metres to cubic centimetres.  Measure the length, the width and the height of the cube in metres . Work out it's volume in cubic metres.   Measure the length, the width and the height of the cube in centimetres. Work out it's volume in cubic centimetres.   How many cubic centimetres is one cubic metre? How can you convert the volume you got in cubic metres to cubic centimetres? Since   Therefore to convert volume from cubic metres to cubic centimetres, we multiply the volume by 1,000,000.    "
