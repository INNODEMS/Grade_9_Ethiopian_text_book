  "body": " Pythagorean relationship     A triangle that contains a right angle (an angle that measures ,symbolized by a small square \"□\") is called a right triangle.    The longest side of the right triangle (the side opposite the angle) is called the hypotenuse and the other two (shorter) sides are called the legs of the triangle.    The legs of a right triangle are commonly labeled \" \" and \" \"while the hypotenuse is labeled \"            Pythagorean relationship is used in real life in different areas. We use the pythagorean relationship in capentry to desighn houses, furniture,fields,land sub-division,When designing buildings or rooms eg your classroom, In sports like basketball, football, or soccer, and many more.    About 2000 years ago, an amazing discovery was made about right angled triangles. If squares of length equivalent to the sides of the triangle, then the sum of the area of the two small squares is exactly the same as the area of the large square. As shown in the figure below;   The ubove description for about 2000 years   Where , and represent the sides of the right-angled triangle       Work in Groups.  Read the story below.   Harriet and Henry are Grade 7 learners. During the August holiday, they visited their grandmother,who lives nearby a village. Their grandmother is a grocer. Harriet and Henry help there grandmother to fetch fruits from a tree for selling.Harriet used a ladder to climb the fruit tree.

Here is the correct Learning point.         The figure formed between the tree, ladder and the ground is a right-angled tringle.    A right-angle triangle has three sides: the base , the perpendicular height and the hypotenuse .    The side that is long is the perpendicular height .    The side that is long is the base .    The side that is long is the hypotenuse .    The longest side in a right-angled triangle is the hypotenuse .    The two shorter sides of this figure are the base and the perpendicular height .

The area is :       Area of a parallelogram     Rectangle is a type of parallelogram where all the angles are 90°    All rectangles are parallelograms, but not all parallelograms are rectangles.        The figure below shows a parallelogram with base and height labeled.       Muchemi's piece of land is in the shape below.   Parallelogram   What is the area of the piece of land?       The area of the piece of land is .    NOTE:     When calculating the area of a parallelogram ensure you use the formula Area     For any drawn figure ensure you've obtaine both the base and height before incoopereting the formula.       Area of a rhombus  A rhombus is a type of quadrilateral that is a special kind of parallelogram. The key characteristics of a rhombus are:     Opposite sides are parallel.    All sides have equal length.    Opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary (they add up to 180°).    The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles (90°), meaning they intersect at a right angle and divide each other into two equal parts.     The formula for the area of a rhombus can be given in two common ways:     Using the diagonals:   where:   and are the lengths of the two diagonals.    Using the base and height:   Where the base is the length of any side (since all sides are equal) and the height is the perpendicular distance between opposite sides.

Will he wear a T-shirt or a warm jacket? Understanding temperature in math helps us make these decisions! It teaches us how to read thermometers, work with negative numbers, and even convert between Degrees Celsius and kelvins.  Have you ever wondered why some countries use different temperature units? Or why water freezes at 0°C but boils at 100°C? Learning about temperature isn’t just about numbers—it helps us understand the world around us.
