    <introduction>
      <p>
        Money is anything that is generally accepted as a medium of exchange for goods and services. 
        It is the medium in which prices and values are
        expressed. Money circulates anonymously from person to person and
        country to country, thus facilitating trade, and it is the principal measure
        of wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Money can be expressed in diffrent currencies eg
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              kenyan currency that is <m>Ksh.</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              United state currency that is <m>dollars ($)</m> and many more.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        In your school,church, home and the market places people use money to;
      </p>
      <p>
        Buy clothes, Pay school fees, buy food, pay expences at home and many more. Therefore money has a broad usein the 
        environment you are situated.

        such loses and profits.

    <title>Profit</title>
    <introduction>
    <p>
      Businesses can make profits or losses. To understand the concepts of
      profit and loss, we will define some terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Cost price (<m>C.P</m>) or Buying price (<m>B.P</m>). This is the price at which the business
            man/woman buys an item.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>Selling price (S.P). This is the price at which a business man sells
        an item. </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      If the selling price is greater than the buying price, the business makes
      profit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore,
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>Profit =Selling\,price (S.P)−Buying \,price(C.P)</m>.

        <m>{\color{blue} \text{Discount}} </m> is the amount of money deducted from the marked price.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can also say, a total bill is usually sold at a discount. 
        Based on the <m>{\color{blue} \text{profit and loss }} </m> concept, the discount is basically the difference 
        between marked price and the selling price.
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>{\color{green} \text{Marked price  }} </m> is the cost set by the seller as per the market standard, 
        and <m>{\color{green} \text{selling price }} </m>  is the price at which the product or commodity has been sold. 
        When the selling price is less than the marked price, 
        then the buyer has said to be got some discount on it.

          Sometimes, traders reduce the prices of items to attract customers. 
          Discount is the amount of money deducted from the marked price. 
          When given a discount, the buying price is less than the original 
          price.
        </p>
        <p>
          The price after the discount is reffered to as the marked price.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        A bill shows the various items sold, their 
        quantities, the price per unit item and cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        It acts as a proof of the payment made or 
        received during a business transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are different types of bills such as; <m> {\color{green} \text{Eectricity bills, telephone bills, 
        water bills, house bills, hotel bills, among others.}}</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        <m> {\color{black} \text{Components of a bill} }</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              A bill always has the <m> {\color{green} \text{Name of the shop }}</m> mentioned on top.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><m> {\color{green}\text{A unique number }}</m> is given to each of the bills. 
          it is called <m> {\color{green} \text{bill number }}</m> or the <m> {\color{green} \text{serial number }}</m> of a bill. 
          It help us find that particular bill easily. <m> {\color{black} \text{No two bill of the same 
          shop will have the same bill number.} }</m></li>
          <li>The date mentioned on the bill is called the <m> {\color{green} \text{Date of purchase. }}</m></li>
          <li>The <m> {\color{green} \text{list of items }}</m> purchased are always given under 
          the item column.</li>
          <li><m> {\color{green} \text{Quantity }}</m> is the total number of each item bought. 
          Quantity can either be in <m> {\color{green} \text{numbers}}</m> or <m> {\color{green} \text{weights.}}</m> For example 
          , one notebook or <m>1</m> kilogram of rice. In this case, the notebook 
          is quantified in numbers, and rice is quantified in weights.</li>
          <li>The <m> {\color{green} \text{cost }}</m> of each item or the rate 
          of each item is the <m> {\color{green} \text{original price }}</m> of each item.</li>
          <li><m> {\color{green} \text{Amount }}</m> to be paid for each item is 
          quantity multiplied by the rate of each item.</li>
          <li>The <m> {\color{green} \text{total amount }}</m> to be paid for the entire purchase is 
          the <m> {\color{green} \text{addition of amounts to be paid }}</m> for each of the items.</li>
