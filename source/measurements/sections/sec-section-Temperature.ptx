     Why Temperature?
  </p>
  <p>
      Uwera wakes up in the morning and checks the weather, and it's cold and it's cold and foggy with temperatures around 9°C. What does that mean? Will he wear a T-shirt or a warm jacket? 
      Understanding temperature in math helps us make these decisions! It teaches us how to read thermometers, work with negative numbers, and even 
      convert between Degrees Celsius and kelvins.

  <p>Have you ever wondered why some countries use different temperature units? Or why water freezes at 0°C but boils at 100°C?
    Learning about temperature isn’t just about numbers—it helps us understand the world around us. 
    So, next time you check the weather, think about how math is helping you plan your day!

          Why do we say it’s ‘as cold as ice’ but never ‘as hot as fire’? Maybe because no one wants to compare themselves to burnt toast!
